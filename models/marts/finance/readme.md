## üìÅ Models Overview

This directory contains one primary analytical model: `high_jackpot_analysis`.

### `high_jackpot_analysis.sql` - High-Value Player Marketing Effectiveness

The `high_jackpot_analysis` model is specifically engineered to analyze the effectiveness of marketing channels in acquiring and converting players who participate in high-jackpot games. This model provides comprehensive insights into marketing ROI, customer acquisition costs, and revenue attribution for high-value players.

#### Purpose

- To identify which marketing channels and campaigns are most effective at acquiring high-jackpot players.
- To calculate detailed ROI metrics for high-value customer acquisition.
- To provide insights into the conversion funnel from marketing touch to high-jackpot participation.
- To enable data-driven decisions for marketing spend allocation and campaign optimization.

#### Business Value

- **Marketing Optimization**: Enables marketing teams to allocate budget more effectively by identifying high-performing channels for high-value players.
- **Revenue Maximization**: Provides insights into which campaigns drive the highest revenue from high-jackpot games.
- **Customer Acquisition Strategy**: Informs strategic decisions about targeting and messaging for high-value player acquisition.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establishes benchmarks for campaign performance and ROI across different channels.

#### Data Sources

This model integrates data from multiple staging models:

- `{{ ref('stg_games') }}`: Game metadata and jackpot information for identifying high-jackpot games.
- `{{ ref('stg_ticket_purchases') }}`: Purchase transactions to identify high-jackpot game participation.
- `{{ ref('stg_web_events') }}`: Marketing touchpoints and attribution data.
- `{{ ref('stg_signups') }}`: Customer signup information for conversion funnel analysis.
- `{{ ref('stg_funnel_spend') }}`: Marketing spend data for ROI calculations.

#### Transformation Logic

The `high_jackpot_analysis` model processes data through several analytical stages:

1. **high_jackpot_games**: Identifies games that meet the high-jackpot threshold criteria using the configurable variable `{{ var('high_jackpot_threshold_minor') }}`. Converts jackpot amounts from minor units to USD for easier analysis.

2. **high_jackpot_purchases**: Joins ticket purchases with high-jackpot games to identify all high-jackpot transactions, including purchase amounts and jackpot estimates.

3. **user_first_high_jackpot**: Aggregates high-jackpot purchase data by user to calculate key metrics:
   - First high-jackpot purchase timestamp
   - Total high-jackpot spend
   - Number of high-jackpot purchases
   - Unique high-jackpot games played

4. **user_marketing_attribution**: Links marketing touchpoints to high-jackpot behavior by:
   - Identifying the first marketing touch for each user
   - Calculating time from first touch to high-jackpot purchase
   - Measuring conversion speed from signup to high-jackpot participation

5. **campaign_high_jackpot_performance**: Aggregates performance metrics at the campaign level:
   - High-jackpot conversion rates
   - Revenue from high-jackpot players
   - ROAS for high-jackpot acquisition
   - Cost per acquisition for high-jackpot players
   - Average spend per high-jackpot player

6. **channel_performance**: Provides channel-level insights by aggregating campaign performance across channels.

7. **high_jackpot_segments**: Creates customer segments based on high-jackpot behavior:
   - Player segments (Whale, High Roller, Regular, Occasional)
   - Engagement levels (Very Engaged, Engaged, Moderately Engaged, Lightly Engaged)
   - Conversion speed categories (Immediate, Quick, Standard, Slow)

#### Key Output Columns

The `high_jackpot_analysis` model outputs comprehensive performance metrics including:

- **Campaign Identification**: `utm_campaign`, `channel`
- **Financial Metrics**: `spend_usd`, `total_high_jackpot_revenue`, `high_jackpot_roas`, `cpa_high_jackpot_player`
- **Conversion Metrics**: `high_jackpot_players`, `high_jackpot_conversion_rate`, `avg_high_jackpot_spend_per_player`
- **Timing Metrics**: `avg_days_to_high_jackpot`, `avg_days_from_signup_to_high_jackpot`
- **Performance Indicators**: `performance_category` (Exceptional, High Performing, Medium Performing, Low Performing)
- **Channel Benchmarks**: `channel_avg_conversion_rate`, `channel_avg_roas`
- **Metadata**: `dbt_updated_at`

#### Data Quality & Governance

The `high_jackpot_analysis` model implements several data quality measures:

- **Threshold Configuration**: Uses dbt variables for configurable high-jackpot thresholds, ensuring flexibility across different business contexts.
- **Null Handling**: Implements proper null handling for users without high-jackpot purchases to ensure accurate conversion rate calculations.
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintains data integrity through proper joins with staging models.
- **Performance Validation**: Includes performance category classifications to identify exceptional and underperforming campaigns.

#### Performance Considerations

- **Materialization**: Materialized as a table to ensure optimal query performance for downstream BI tools and consistent data availability.
- **Aggregation Strategy**: Pre-computes complex aggregations and calculations to reduce query time for end users.
- **Indexing**: The model structure supports efficient filtering and sorting by campaign, channel, and performance metrics.
