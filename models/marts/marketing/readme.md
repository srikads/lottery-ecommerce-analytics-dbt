- **Conversion Funnel Analysis**: How do customers move through the marketing funnel from first touch to conversion?

## üìÅ Models Overview

This directory contains one primary analytical model: `marketing_attribution`.

### `marketing_attribution.sql` - Comprehensive Marketing Attribution Analysis

The `marketing_attribution` model is specifically engineered to provide comprehensive marketing attribution analysis, combining first-touch and multi-touch attribution methodologies to deliver accurate insights into marketing campaign performance and ROI.

#### Purpose

- To calculate accurate Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) for marketing campaigns based on first-time deposits.
- To provide both first-touch and multi-touch attribution models for comprehensive marketing analysis.
- To measure conversion rates and customer acquisition costs across different marketing channels.
- To enable data-driven decisions for marketing budget allocation and campaign optimization.

#### Business Value

- **Marketing ROI Optimization**: Enables marketing teams to identify high-performing campaigns and allocate budget more effectively.
- **Attribution Accuracy**: Provides multiple attribution models to understand the true impact of marketing efforts across the customer journey.
- **Conversion Funnel Insights**: Offers detailed analysis of the time from marketing touch to conversion, enabling funnel optimization.
- **Channel Performance Comparison**: Facilitates comparison of performance across different marketing channels and campaigns.

#### Data Sources

This model integrates data from multiple staging models:

- `{{ ref('stg_funnel_spend') }}`: Marketing spend data for campaign cost analysis and ROI calculations.
- `{{ ref('stg_web_events') }}`: Marketing touchpoints and attribution data for understanding customer journey.
- `{{ ref('stg_signups') }}`: Customer signup information for conversion funnel analysis.
- `{{ ref('stg_deposits') }}`: Deposit transactions for revenue attribution and conversion measurement.

#### Transformation Logic

The `marketing_attribution` model processes data through several analytical stages:

1. **campaign_spend**: Standardizes marketing spend data by converting minor units to USD and preparing campaign cost data for attribution analysis.

2. **first_touch_attribution**: Implements first-touch attribution methodology by:
   - Identifying the first marketing touch for each user
   - Calculating time from first touch to signup and first deposit
   - Linking marketing touchpoints to conversion events
   - Measuring conversion timing and effectiveness

3. **campaign_attribution**: Aggregates first-touch attribution metrics at the campaign level:
   - Attributed users and depositing users
   - Total and average first deposit amounts
   - Conversion rates from signup to deposit
   - ROAS calculations based on first deposits
   - Cost per acquisition metrics

4. **multi_touch_attribution**: Implements weighted multi-touch attribution by:
   - Identifying all marketing touches in the customer journey
   - Assigning weights to different touch positions (first touch: 40%, last touch: 40%, middle touches: 20%)
   - Calculating weighted attribution for more accurate campaign impact measurement

5. **weighted_attribution**: Aggregates multi-touch attribution metrics:
   - Weighted touches and unique users
   - Weighted depositing users and deposit value
   - Weighted ROAS calculations

6. **Final SELECT**: Combines first-touch and multi-touch attribution results with:
   - Performance indicators and categories
   - Attribution comparison metrics
   - Channel effectiveness classifications

#### Key Output Columns

The `marketing_attribution` model outputs comprehensive marketing performance metrics including:

- **Campaign Identification**: `utm_campaign`, `channel`
- **Financial Metrics**: `spend_usd`, `total_first_deposits_usd`, `avg_first_deposit_usd`
- **First-Touch Attribution**: `attributed_users`, `depositing_users`, `roas_first_deposit`, `cpa_first_deposit`
- **Conversion Metrics**: `signup_to_deposit_conversion_rate`, `avg_days_to_signup`, `avg_days_to_first_deposit`
- **Multi-Touch Attribution**: `weighted_touches`, `weighted_depositing_users`, `weighted_roas`
- **Performance Indicators**: `performance_category` (High Performing, Medium Performing, Low Performing)
- **Conversion Categories**: `conversion_category` (High Conversion, Medium Conversion, Low Conversion)
- **Attribution Comparison**: `attribution_difference` (difference between first-touch and weighted ROAS)
- **Metadata**: `dbt_updated_at`

#### Attribution Methodologies

The model implements two complementary attribution approaches:

1. **First-Touch Attribution**: Attributes 100% of the conversion value to the first marketing touch, useful for understanding initial customer acquisition effectiveness.

2. **Multi-Touch Attribution**: Uses a weighted approach where:
   - First touch receives 40% of attribution (customer discovery)
   - Last touch receives 40% of attribution (final conversion driver)
   - Middle touches share the remaining 20% (nurturing and engagement)

This dual approach provides a more nuanced understanding of marketing effectiveness across the customer journey.

#### Data Quality & Governance

The `marketing_attribution` model implements several data quality measures:

- **Null Handling**: Proper handling of null values in conversion calculations to ensure accurate metrics.
- **Division by Zero Protection**: Implements `nullif` functions to prevent division by zero in rate calculations.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures marketing spend data is properly linked to campaign attribution data.
- **Performance Classification**: Automatic categorization of campaigns based on performance thresholds.

#### Performance Considerations

- **Materialization**: Materialized as a table to ensure optimal query performance for downstream BI tools and consistent data availability.
- **Aggregation Strategy**: Pre-computes complex attribution calculations to reduce query time for end users.
- **Indexing**: The model structure supports efficient filtering and sorting by campaign, channel, and performance metrics.

#### Business Applications

This model directly supports several key marketing initiatives:

1. **Campaign Performance Analysis**: Identify top-performing campaigns and channels for budget optimization.

2. **ROI Reporting**: Provide executive-level reporting on marketing ROI and customer acquisition costs.

3. **Attribution Strategy**: Understand the relative importance of different touchpoints in the customer journey.

4. **Conversion Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in the conversion funnel and opportunities for improvement.

5. **Budget Allocation**: Make data-driven decisions about marketing spend allocation across channels and campaigns.

6. **A/B Testing Support**: Provide baseline metrics for campaign testing and optimization.
