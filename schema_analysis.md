# Schema.yml Analysis: Data Contract and Custom Business Rule Tests

## 📋 **Overview**

This document analyzes the schema.yml files in the lottery e-commerce analytics dbt project, explaining how they serve as data contracts for consumers and documenting the custom business rule tests that enforce critical business logic.

## 🎯 **Schema.yml File Structure**

The project contains comprehensive schema.yml files across multiple layers:

- **`models/staging/schema.yml`**: Staging layer data contracts
- **`models/marts/customer/schema.yml`**: Customer domain data contracts
- **`models/marts/marketing/schema.yml`**: Marketing domain data contracts  
- **`models/marts/finance/schema.yml`**: Finance domain data contracts

## 📊 **Complete Column Descriptions**

### Example: Customer Dimension Table

```yaml
- name: dim_customer
  description: "Customer dimension table with comprehensive customer attributes and behavior metrics"
  config:
    materialized: table
  columns:
    - name: user_id
      description: "Primary key - unique identifier for each customer"
      tests:
        - not_null
        - unique
    
    - name: total_purchases
      description: "Total number of ticket purchases made by the customer"
      tests:
        - not_null
        - positive_values
    
    - name: customer_segment
      description: "Customer segment based on purchase behavior (High Value, Medium Value, Low Value, No Purchase)"
      tests:
        - not_null
        - accepted_values:
            values: ['High Value', 'Medium Value', 'Low Value', 'No Purchase']
```

### Key Features:
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Every column has a clear business definition
- **Data Types**: Implicit data type documentation through test constraints
- **Business Context**: Descriptions include business logic and categorization
- **Validation Rules**: Tests ensure data meets business requirements

## 🔧 **Custom Business Rule Test: `assert_purchase_after_signup`**

### Business Rule Enforced
**"A player's first ticket purchase cannot occur before their signup"**

### Implementation

**File**: `tests/assert_purchase_after_signup.sql`

```sql
-- Custom test: Ensure ticket purchases happen after user signup
-- This enforces the business rule that a player's first ticket purchase cannot occur before their signup

with signup_times as (
    select 
        user_id,
        signup_timestamp
    from {{ ref('stg_signups') }}
),

purchase_times as (
    select 
        user_id,
        min(purchase_timestamp) as first_purchase_timestamp
    from {{ ref('stg_ticket_purchases') }}
    group by user_id
),

validation as (
    select 
        s.user_id,
        s.signup_timestamp,
        p.first_purchase_timestamp,
        case 
            when p.first_purchase_timestamp < s.signup_timestamp then 1 
            else 0 
        end as invalid_purchase
    from signup_times s
    inner join purchase_times p on s.user_id = p.user_id
)

select *
from validation 
where invalid_purchase = 1 
```

### How the Test Works

1. **Extract Signup Data**: Gets signup timestamps for each user
2. **Find First Purchases**: Identifies the earliest purchase for each user
3. **Compare Timestamps**: Validates that purchase occurs after signup
4. **Flag Violations**: Returns records where business rule is violated
5. **Test Success**: Test passes when no violations are found

### Business Impact
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures logical consistency in customer journey data
- **Analytics Accuracy**: Prevents invalid time-based calculations
- **Business Logic**: Enforces fundamental business rules at the data level

## 🛠️ **Additional Custom Tests**

### 1. Positive Values Test

**File**: `macros/test_positive_values.sql`

```sql
{% test positive_values(model, column_name) %}

with validation as (
    select
        {{ column_name }} as value_field
    from {{ model }}
),

validation_errors as (
    select
        value_field
    from validation
    where value_field <= 0
)

select *
from validation_errors

{% endtest %}
```

**Usage**: Applied to monetary fields (deposits, purchases, spend amounts)

### 2. Non-Negative Values Test

**File**: `macros/test_non_negative_values.sql`

```sql
{% test non_negative_values(model, column_name) %}

with validation as (
    select
        {{ column_name }} as value_field
    from {{ model }}
),

validation_errors as (
    select
        value_field
    from validation
    where value_field < 0
)

select *
from validation_errors

{% endtest %}
```

**Usage**: Applied to count fields (web events, campaigns, games played)

## 📋 **How Schema.yml Serves as a Data Contract**

### 1. **Clear Data Definitions**

The schema.yml files provide explicit contracts for data consumers:

```yaml
# Example: Clear business definition with validation
- name: customer_segment
  description: "Customer segment based on purchase behavior (High Value, Medium Value, Low Value, No Purchase)"
  tests:
    - accepted_values:
        values: ['High Value', 'Medium Value', 'Low Value', 'No Purchase']
```

**Benefits:**
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Analysts understand exactly what each field means
- **Consistent Interpretation**: Everyone uses the same business definitions
- **Reduced Support**: Clear documentation reduces questions and errors

### 2. **Data Quality Guarantees**

The schema.yml enforces quality standards through automated tests:

```yaml
# Primary Key Integrity
- name: user_id
  tests:
    - not_null
    - unique

# Referential Integrity  
- name: user_id
  tests:
    - relationships:
        to: ref('stg_signups')
        field: user_id

# Business Logic Validation
- name: total_purchases
  tests:
    - positive_values  # Custom test ensures > 0
```

**Benefits:**
- **Data Reliability**: Consumers can trust the data quality
- **Error Prevention**: Tests catch issues before they reach consumers
- **Confidence**: Analysts know the data meets business standards

### 3. **Business Rule Enforcement**

The schema.yml implements business logic as tests:

```yaml
# Domain Validation
- name: country
  tests:
    - accepted_values:
        values: ['US', 'CA', 'GB', 'DE', 'FR', 'AU']

# Channel Validation
- name: channel
  tests:
    - accepted_values:
        values: ['Email', 'Social', 'Search', 'Display', 'Affiliate']
```

**Benefits:**
- **Business Logic Centralization**: Rules are defined once and enforced everywhere
- **Consistency**: All downstream models inherit the same business rules
- **Maintainability**: Changes to business rules are made in one place

### 4. **Data Lineage and Dependencies**

The schema.yml shows relationships between models:

```yaml
# Foreign Key Relationships
- name: user_id
  tests:
    - relationships:
        to: ref('stg_signups')
        field: user_id
```

**Benefits:**
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand how changes affect downstream models
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow through the pipeline
- **Dependency Management**: Know which models depend on each other

### 5. **Self-Documenting Code**

The schema.yml provides living documentation:

```yaml
# Model-level documentation
- name: dim_customer
  description: "Customer dimension table with comprehensive customer attributes and behavior metrics"

# Column-level documentation  
- name: ltv_score
  description: "Overall LTV score (0-100)"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Always Current**: Documentation stays in sync with code
- **Automated Generation**: dbt can generate documentation from schema.yml
- **Team Collaboration**: Everyone has access to the same information

## 🎯 **Data Contract Benefits by Consumer Type**
